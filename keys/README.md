Files expected to be in this directory are expected to contain strings, followed by a newline (although they probably don't need to be):
- *lolol-token* : The token used for validating request signatures.
- *textmarks-api* : The key for Textmarks API requests.

These files are security-critical. Care should be taken to keep them private and out of source control.
